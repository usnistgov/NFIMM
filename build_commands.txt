# Windows
Build output may be redirected to any convenient dir by utilizing the '-B' switch for the 'cmake' command.
For the Windows examples below, build output is redirected to RAMDRIVE (R:\).  A nice tool to create RAMDRIVE for
Windows is OFSMount (osforensics.com).

Open a PowerShell terminal, create and change-to the 'build' subdir, and run:

.\NFIMM\build> cmake -S .. -B R:\NFIMM_ITL -DCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="Release" -D_WIN32_64=1
.\NFIMM\build> MSBuild.exe R:\NFIMM_ITL\NFIMM_ITL.sln

Library file is located here on successful build:
R:\NFIMM_ITL\src\lib\Release\NFIMM_ITL.lib

## How to Run Example Binary
Open a terminal:
```
R:\NFIMM_ITL\src\bin\Release>NFIMM_bin.exe
```

# Linux and Mac
In a terminal, create and change-to the 'build' subdir, and run:

./NFIMM/build$ cmake ..
./NFIMM/build$ make

Library file is located here on successful build:
./NFIMM/src/lib/libNFIMM.a

# How to Run Example Binary
Open a terminal:
```
user:~/.../NFIMM/build$ ./src/bin/NFIMM_bin
```
